    "**Step 1**: Define the Prediction Problem\n",
    "Target: Choose your prediction objective. Most common:\n",
    "- Binary: Will the return over the next h days be positive?\n",
    "- Regression: What will the return over h days be?\n",
    "- Classification: Momentum regime (uptrend, downtrend, sideways)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Label the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Triple Barrier Method: Defines label = +1, -1, or 0 based on price hitting profit/stop/timeout\n",
    "- Trend Scanning: Finds significant directional moves without arbitrary thresholds\n",
    "- Simple Return Sign: e.g. np.sign(fwd_return)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Price-based: Momentum, volatility, skew, drawdown\n",
    "- Volume-based: Volume spikes, VWAP deviations\n",
    "- Sentiment: NLP score from tweets/news\n",
    "- Macro: Interest rates, inflation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize using z-scores, winsorization, or rolling transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Handle Sample Weights & Overlap\n",
    "Apply decay weights if using overlapping labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use sequential bootstrapping for model training to avoid lookahead bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5**: Train Your Model\n",
    "- Use tree-based models (e.g. XGBoost, RandomForest) or logistic regression for interpretability.\n",
    "- Always use Purged Walk-Forward Cross-Validation to avoid leakage from overlapping data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6**: Backtest Strategy Logic\n",
    "- Long assets with high predicted probability of positive return\n",
    "- Short low-probability assets (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Account for:\n",
    "- Transaction costs\n",
    "- Holding periods\n",
    "- Rebalancing frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7**: Evaluate Strategy\n",
    "- Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "- Hit Ratio\n",
    "- Max Drawdown\n",
    "- Turnover\n",
    "- IC / IR of model signal"
