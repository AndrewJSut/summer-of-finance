    "### Section 8 - Test Set Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulations play in mathematics the analogue to a controlled experiment in the physical sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A backtest is a historical simulation of how an investment strategy would have performed in the past. It is not a controlled experiment, because we cannot change the environmental variables to derive a new historical time series on which to perform an independent backtest.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy for a researcher to overfit a backtest, by conducting multiple historical simulations, and selecting the best performing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a researcher presents an overfit backtest as the outcome of a single trial, the simulated performance is inflated. This form of statistical inflation is called selection bias under multiple testing (SBuMT)\n",
    "\n",
    "SBuMT is compounded by asset managers through sequential SBuMT at two levels: \n",
    "- (1) each researcher runs millions of simulations and presents the best (overfit) ones to her boss; \n",
    "- (2) the company further selects a few backtests among the (already overfit) backtests submitted by the researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may call this backtest hyperfitting, to differentiate it from backtest overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we study how researchers can estimate the effect that SBuMT has on their findings."

    "#### 8.2 Precision and Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $s$ investment strategies. Some of these are false discoveries, in the sense that their expected return is not positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can decompose these strategies into true and false: $s = s_T+s_F$. Let $\\theta$ be the odds ratio of true strategies against false strategies: $\\theta = \\frac{s_T}{s_F}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial economics, $\\theta$ is expected to be low. The number of true investment strategies is: $$s_T = s \\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}$$ and the number of false investment strategies is: $$s_F = s \\frac{1}{1+\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Give a false positive rate $\\alpha$, we will obtain a number of false positives $FP = \\alpha s_F$ and a number of true negatives $TN = (1-\\alpha)s_F$. Let us denote by $\\beta$ the false negative rate associated with $\\alpha$. We will obtain a nmber of false negatives $FN = \\beta s_T$ and true positives $TP = (1-\\beta) s_T$. Therefore the precision and recall of our test are: $$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP} = \\frac{(1-\\beta)\\theta}{(1-\\beta)\\theta+\\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$recall = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}=1-\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running backtests on a strategy, researchers should gather evidence that a strategy may indeed exist. The reason is the precision of the test is a function of the odds ratio, \\theta. If the odds ratio is love, the precision will be low, even if we get a positive with high confidence (low $p$-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: Suppose that the probability of a backtested strategy being profitable is 0.01, that is, that one out of one hundred strategies is true, hence $\\theta$=1/99. Then, at the standard thresholds of $\\alpha = 0.05, \\beta = 0.2$, researchers are expected to get approximately fifty-eight positives out one thousand trials, where approximately eight are true positives, and approximately fifty are false positives. Under these circumstances, a p-value of 0.05 implies a false discovery rate of 86.09% (roughly 50/58). For this reason alone, we should expect that most discoveries in financial econometrics are likely false."

    "After one trial, the probability of making a type I error is $\\alpha$, and the probability of not making a type I error is $1-\\alpha$. IF two trials are independant, the probability of not making a type I error on the first *and* second tests is $(1-\\alpha)^2$. If we conduct K independent trials, the joint probability of not making a single type I error is $(1-\\alpha)^K$. Hence the probability of making at least one type I error is the complement: $\\alpha_K = 1-(1-\\alpha)^K$. This is known as the familywise error rate (FWER).\n",

    "#### 8.4 The Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial analysts do not typically assess the performance of a strategy in terms of precision and recall. The most common measure of strategy performance is the Sharpe ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will develop a framework for assessing the probability that a strategy is false. The inputs are the Sharpe ratio estimate, as well as metadata captured during the discovery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an investment strategy with excess returns (or risk premia) $\\{r_t\\}$, $t=1,...,T$, which are independent and IID normal, $r_t \\sim N[\\mu,\\sigma^2]$. The nonannualized Sharpe ratio of such a strategy is defined as $$SR=\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these parameters are not known, SR is esitmated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{SR}=\\frac{E[\\{r_t\\}]}{\\sqrt{V[\\{r_t\\}]}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption that returns are IID normal, we can derive the asymptotic distribution of $\\hat{SR}$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\hat{SR}-SR)\\rightarrow^a N [0,\\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}SR^2}{T}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, empirical evidence shows that hedge fund returns exhibit substantial negative skewness and positive excess kurtosis. Wrongly assuming the returns are IID Normal can lead to a gross underestimation of the false positive probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption that returns are drawn from IID non-Normal distributions, Mertons derived the asymptotic distribution as $$(\\hat{SR}-SR)\\rightarrow^a N [0,\\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}SR^2-\\gamma_3SR+\\frac{\\gamma_4-3}{4}SR^2}{T}]$$ where $\\gamma_3$ is the skewness of $\\{r_t\\}$ and $\\gamma_4$ is the kurtosis of $\\{r_t\\}$. Shortly after, researchers discovered that this equation is also valid under the more general assumption that returns are stationary and ergodic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key implication is that $\\hat{SR}$ still follows a Normal distribution even if returns are non-Normal, however with a variance that partly depends on the skewness and kurtosis of the returns."

    "#### The \"False Strategy Theorem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher may carry out a large number of historical simulations (trials), and report only the best outcome (maximum Sharpe ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the maximum Sharpe ratio is not the same as the distribution of a Sharpe ratio randomly chosen among the trials, hence giving rise to SBuMT.\n",
    "\n",
    "When more than one trial takes place, the expected value of the maximum Sharpe ratio is greater than the expected value of the Sharpe ratio from a random trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, given an investment strategy with expected Sharpe ratio zero and nonnull variance, the expected value of the maximum Sharpe ratio is strictly positive, and a function of the number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, the magnitude of SBuMT can be expressed in terms of the difference between the expected maximum Sharpe ratio and the expected Sharpe ratio from a random trial (zero, in the case of a false strategy). As it turns out, SBuMT is a function of two variables: the number of trials, and the variance of the Sharpe ratios across trials. The following theorem formally states that relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem: Given a sample of estimated performance statistics $\\{\\hat{SR}_k\\}$, $k=1,...,K$, drawn from IID Gaussians, $\\hat{SR}_k \\sim N[0, V[\\hat{SR}_k]]$, then\n",

    "#### 8.6 Experimental Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The False Strategy theorem provides us with an approximation of the expected maximum Sharpe ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "An experimental analysis of this theorem can be useful at two levels. First, it can help us find evidence that the theorem is not true, and in fact the proof is flawed. Of course, the converse is not true: experimental evidence can never replace the role of a mathematical proof. Still, experimental evidence can point to problems with the proof, and give us a better understanding of what the proof should look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the theorem does not provide a boundary for the approximation. An experimental analysis can help us estimate the distribution of the approximation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Monte Carlo experiment evaluates the accuracy of the False Strategy theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, given a pair of values $(K, V[\\hat{SR}_k])$, we generate a random array of size SxK, where S is the number of Monte Carlo experiments. The values contained by this random array are drawn from a Standard Normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, the rows in this array are centered and scaled to match zero mean and $V[\\hat{SR}_k]$ variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Third, the maximum value accross each row is computed, resulting in S of such maxima. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fourth, we compute the average value across S maxima, $\\hat{E}[\\max_k \\{\\hat{SR}_k\\}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fifth, this empirical estimate of the expected maximum SR can be compared with the analytical solution provided by the False Strategy theorem, $E[\\max_k \\{\\hat{SR}_k\\}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sixth, the estimation error is defined in relative terms to the predicted value as, $$\\epsilon = \\frac{\\hat{E}[\\max_k \\{\\hat{SR}_k\\}]}{E[\\max_k \\{\\hat{SR}_k\\}]}-1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seventh, we repeat these steps R times, resulting in $\\{\\epsilon_r \\}_{r=1,...,R}$, allowing us to compute the mean and standard deviation of the esitmation errors associated with K trials. The following code implements this Monte Carlo experiment."

This theorem derives the expected value of the maximum Sharpe ratio as a function of the number of trials, K, and the variance of the Sharpe ratios across the trials.
